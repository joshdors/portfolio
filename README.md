Bare-bones 11ty starter template using Tailwind CSS. This is a good starting point for simple static websites.

## Getting started

Run `npm i` to install depencies and `npm start` to build your static website for local development. The site will be live at: http://localhost:8080.

## Deploying the site

If you would like to deploy your website to Netlify, set **publish directory** to `site` and **build command** to `npm run build`.
