## Introduction 

I really enjoy solving problems and helping people through design. So, for a fun side project I wanted to create an app that makes it easy to search and apply to jobs. Right now, if you were to go on LinkedIn, Indeed or any other job search website, the overall user experience can be confusing and sometimes even frustrating. My goal with this project is to design a product that addresses these problems and adds helpful features.

## Search

One of my biggest gripes with the most popular job search websites is that the search doesn't always return the results I want. To explain this better, I've added a screenshot below showing some results of a search I made on Indeed for 'Web Designer'. On the first page of results (sorted by most recent), there were 16 results, with only 4 having 'Web Designer' in the title. The user shouldn't have to sift through that many jobs to find the ones they searched for.

## Cards

In some instances, cards can have too much information related to the job. In the example from Indeed below, about 1/3 of the vertical space is taken up to display an excerpt of the job description. The more information added, the more cognitive load increases, making the interface feel busy and overwhelming.

## Tracking

Instead of using another service (Like Notion) to view, track, and manage job applications, it should be part of the service. On LinkedIn, the only way to track which jobs you've applied to is if they are "Easy Apply". For external job postings, there's no way to track them.

## Starting

I like to begin each project I work on by designing a feature or main component, as it can set the tone of the product. For this project, I started by creating the card design for a job posting.

I began by planning what information should be added to a card. I decided on including the position title, company name, location, and expiration date of the job. The goal here was to design a card that presents the most important information without being too busy. 

Here's a glimpse of what that might look like:

## Brainstorming

After designing the card component, I began creating wireframes for the three main screens of the app: the search page, the home page, and a 'My Jobs' page where users can view saved jobs and applications.

### Search

For the search page, I aimed to keep it as simple and straightforward as possible, allowing users to filter and search for jobs easily, with the goal of making it feel familiar and intuitive.

The main functions of this page are search, filter, and view results. Additionally, I've included a few small features to enhance the user experience. For instance, users can hide jobs that they've already saved.

Moving forward with the completed UI of this project, the job posting detail screen will require additional details for the user. Instead of navigating to a separate screen to view company information, it will be integrated within the detail view.

### My jobs

The 'My jobs' page provides an easy way to view all saved, archived, and applied-to jobs.

It features a layout similar to the search page, complete with a search bar and filters. These filters enable users to conveniently sort jobs based on their saved or applied statuses.

Each job card includes a status indicator. For instance, if a job has been applied to, the status might display as "Applied March 25th". If the application has been viewed by the company, the status could indicate "Application viewed March 30th".

Clicking on a job that a user has applied to opens a modal window, offering a more detailed overview and providing the option to view the submitted application. If the job is saved, it simply opens the job posting details.

### Home

The home page serves as a means for users to quickly access saved searches and recommended jobs based on their search history. Each 'quick search' tab is also customizable, allowing users to add, remove, and reorder tabs.

Below are three initial ideas I had. The rightmost one was the last wireframe I designed and the layout I believe works best.

For this project, I'll be designing three main screens:

- **Home:** Where the user can get a visual overview of jobs they've saved and applied to.
- **Search**: Where the user can search for jobs and choose whether to apply or save and apply later.
- **My jobs**: A way to track all jobs you've applied to and view the status of an application.

Before starting my design, I took some time analyzing services like LinkedIn and Indeed to see which areas of their interfaces could be improved. Here are the three main areas I'd like to improve in my design:
